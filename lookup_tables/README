        These tables were generated elsewhere for the IllustrisTNG cosmology:

                Omega_m      = 0.3089
                Omega_b      = 0.0486
                h            = 0.6774
                ns           = 0.967
                sigma_8(z=0) = 0.816

        The tables contain power spectra, their first and second derivatives w.r.t. k, and the growth-only response functions G1, G2 and GK.

        For the spectra, there is the option in ../prepare_for_lensing.py to choose between CAMB or the Coyote emulator.

        For the responses, they come from separate universe simulation measurements.
